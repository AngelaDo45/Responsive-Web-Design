        <h2>What are Eco-Bricks?</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Eco bricks are water bottles filled with single use plastics such as grocery bags, labels, and food packaging.
                Once the plastic bottles are filled, they become a hard, sturdy piece of equipment that can be used for building structures such as houses and furniture. </li>

        <!--What are the Pros? -->
        <h2>What are the Pros?</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">By making ecobricks, plastic is removed oceans and landfills. Less oceanic waste is beneficial for both marine wildlife and human recreation.
            As well, eco-bricks can be used for structrual support for shelter, making it a accessible and cheap resource for use. 
            Lastly, on an help individuals, creating an eco-brick can help one gain a better understanding to the vast amount of single use plastic that is consumed and polluted. </p>
            
        <!--What are the Cons? -->
        <h2>What are the Cons?</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                There are however, several rising concerns with the growing concepts of ecobricks. 
                First, eco-bricks but be carefully created. The plastic used to fill up the bottle must not be contaminated with food particles, or else methane may build up in the bottle over time and explode.
                Secondly, these bricks come with a risk when used in construction. The bricks will most likely weaken in the heat, cannot withstand as much pressure as standard building materials like wood and cement,and can leech chemicals when wet. 
                Lastly, eco-bricks are not a long term feasible solution, so some argue that eco-bricks distract from the bigger environmental problem at hand. (As in, that plastic production needs to be drastically reduced.)

        <!--Final Verdict/Summary -->
        <h2>Final Verdict/Summary</h2>
            <p class="paragraph" >Ecobricks provide a good opportunity to both utilise the vast amount of single use soft plastics, and provide housing/shelter in developing nations. However, it is not a long time feasible solution to solve our current plastic epidemic. There are also concerns regarding the safety and structural integrity when using Eco-Bricks in construction. </p>
